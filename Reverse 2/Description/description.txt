The Gatekeeper.exe
Category: Reverse Engineering

An unassuming .exe guards the flag behind a secret PIN. Enter the wrong code, and it stays silent. Enter the right one, and the flag is yours. Somewhere within its logic, the correct key is hidden, waiting for someone bold enough to uncover it.

Can you reverse the programâ€™s defenses and find the one PIN that unlocks the secret?
