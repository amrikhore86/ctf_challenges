Serpent’s Cipher
Category: Reverse Engineering

A rogue mathematician tried to protect a precious flag by twisting it through a series of Python-powered calculations. Addition, subtraction, maybe even some sneaky bitwise tricks—you name it. The final scrambled result now sits in a lonely .txt file, waiting for someone clever enough to untangle it.

The code that caused this chaos is in your hands… but the original flag isn’t. Can you reverse the logic and bring the hidden flag back to life?
